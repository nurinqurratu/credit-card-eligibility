# 💳 Data Mining: Credit Card Eligibility Prediction  

This project applies **data mining techniques** to predict whether a credit card applicant is eligible or not based on their **personal data and lifestyle attributes**.  
The model is trained using the **Random Tree algorithm in WEKA** to assess the **riskiness of applicants** and predict credit card subscription eligibility.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Train a dataset to predict the **risk level of applicants** requesting credit cards.  
2. Build and evaluate models for **eligibility classification**.  
3. Test the model to ensure accurate prediction of risky applicants.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Workflow  
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Used a dataset from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanayatipre/car-price-prediction-dataset/data)** containing applicant personal and lifestyle details.  
- **Feature Selection**: Identified relevant attributes influencing credit card eligibility.  
- **Model Training**: Implemented the **Random Tree algorithm in WEKA** to build the model.  
- **Evaluation**: Analyzed performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in WEKA.  

---

## 📊 Results  
- The **Random Tree model** achieved **XX% accuracy** (replace with your actual result).  
- Key factors influencing prediction included **income level, spending habits, and credit history**.  
- The model successfully differentiated between eligible and risky applicants.
